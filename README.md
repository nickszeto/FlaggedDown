## A little back story

Back to the days of Uber, Grab and all other ride-hailing app that is currently flooding the market, together with a couple of University folks taking a mobile development module we had to develop a mobile app on a Window phone (oh gosh, i wonder are these devices still being used almost a decade on). 

### Concept

The idea was very simple, an app that uses a person's location to identify available taxis within a certain range. The aim was to help the passenger directly "ping" the nearest available driver and direct the driver to the passenger's location to pick up.
